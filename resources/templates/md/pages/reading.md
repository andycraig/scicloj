## Tutorials 

Tutorials play an important role on our journey to make Clojure an accessible, friendly platform for data science.

Of course, they allow us to share and learn existing methods and practices. No less importantly, working on tutorials helps us see the toolset meet its use cases, and thus realize what is still missing, and what could be improved.
