We follow a simple workflow for the creation of tutorials.

To summarize it, roughly, in one line:
* readiness announcement -> selection of reviewer -> review process -> acceptance/disapproval -> announcement -> webpage

Here it is, in detail:

1. Start - an announcement at the [#scicloj-tutorials](https://clojurians.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/187445-scicloj-tutorials) Zulip stream, under a separate thread ("[topic](https://zulipchat.com/help/about-streams-and-topics)"), that the tutorial/article is ready for review.

2. (optional) The author may ask specific people from the group by name for review.

3. Someone takes responsibility as the reviewer, and creates a private Zulip stream for discussion.

4. The reviewer checks for the following basic requirements:
  * instructions how to run the provided code, to achieve the same or similar results;
  * obligatory sections: intorduction/abstract about the topic coverage list (goals), instalation/running notes, conclusion/summary;
  * a link to the relevant Zulip discussion, as well as a note how to contact the author (mail, Zulip, github, etc.).

5. The reviewer proceeds with the following:
  * kind of a scientific review, if the topic covers some theoretical parts;
  * proofreading;
  * walking through the whole tutorial/article, trying to run all the code.

6. Feedback is given in a private stream (important: always explain why and be polite):
  * all the stuff found during checks;
  * gaps in narration;
  * (optional) possible enhancement.

7. The author incorporates the reviewer's suggestions (or not, if they are not applicable).

8. This process iterates, until both decide to stop (with or without success).

9. The reviewer comments, under the above [#scicloj-tutorials](https://clojurians.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/187445-scicloj-tutorials) topic dedicated to the tutorial, about the conclusions (approval or not, if not - why, maybe other review is needed).

10. The author decides where and when to announce the article.

11. In a case where the reviewer accepts the tutorial/article, a link to will be added at the scicloj website.
