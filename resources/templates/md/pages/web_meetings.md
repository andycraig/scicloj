Online gatherings are where we meet to have some thinking together. Usually, one main topic is presented, and then we have an open discussion afterwards.

Some meetings are open. Others take the interview format -- 2-3 people interviewing usually 1 person, about that person's projects/workflow/research.

You can find the meeting videos [here](http://yt.vu/+scicloj).

Do you have and idea for a topic? - [Let us talk](../about/#where)!
